    Try asking quantitative questions like:
        - Are there more images than videos or audio in the collections?
        - What is the most common creator variant?
        - How many works are there by work type?
        - What embedding models were used to generate the embeddings for the collections? How many works were generated with each model?

        - Can you show me works about Willie Mays?
        - Which musicians played the Berkeley Folk Music Festival?
        - What kinds of food could you order on a transantlantic flight during the golden age of air travel?
